# Introduction

In hackweek events, participants get the opportunity to learn and engage with new concepts through *tutorials*. These usually take the form of a 60-to-90 minute classroom session in which a content expert, the "*tutorial lead*", leads the audience through an interactive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a particular computational technique or dataset. 

Although the central artifact of a tutorial is its jupyter notebook, this notebook is actually used in two different and equally important contexts:

- The *synchronous* time that the tutorial lead spends with participants while teaching, where the notebook serves as an outline and presentation tool.
- The *asynchronous* time that participants spend after the tutorial, where the notebook serves as a subject reference and code "cookbook".

Effective tutorials are designed with this division in mind, using their synchronous time to engage and inspire learners by showing them the "tip of the iceberg," after which participants can dig into the notebook's deeper material.

The rest of this chapter covers the goals, considerations, and best practices regarding tutorial design and delivery to make the most out of the event participants' time together.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, tutorial leads will:

* create hackweek [learning objectives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/learning-objective) using Bloom's Taxonomy
* understand basic principles of adult learning
* incorporate the appropriate level of interactivity into tutorial design
* apply knowledge of pedagogical design to create tutorials at appropriate level of depth and complexity for the hackweek
* gain experience in presenting tutorials in an engaging way
* be familiar with our suite of hackweek [learning technologies](../technology/index.md)

## What to expect as a tutorial lead

Hackweeks have traditionally been very dynamic events at which knowledge is exchanged in multiple directions across different levels of career position and backgrounds. We hope you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things by engaging in this experience.

Past tutorial leads have used these events to gain teaching experience and as a way to round out their teaching profile. Like other participants you can also expect to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.

In crafting a tutorial you'll gain valuable experience with creating reproducible computation examples. And together we'll collaborate on building digital content that will serve as a public resource with a citable DOI so that all tutorial authors receive credit for the effort!

# Tutorial Notebooks

## Formatting

An effective format for tutorial content is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook that provides participants with narrative text and interactive code examples. Notebooks can contain a wide variety of embedded media (images, videos, equations, etc.) and can be easily rendered on hackweek event websites.

We recommend that all notebooks make use of sections with the following minimal structure:
```
# Title
* Learning objectives *
## Software
## Data
## My Section
### My Subsection
## Summary
## References
```

For convenience you can start with a copy of our [template notebook](https://uwhackweek.github.io/jupyterbook-template/tutorials/example/tutorial-notebook.html), which you can download [here](https://github.com/uwhackweek/jupyterbook-template/raw/main/book/tutorials/example/tutorial-notebook.ipynb).


### Examples of formatting

Spend a bit of time looking at these examples from past events:
